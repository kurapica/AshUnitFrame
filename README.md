Usage

I don't if anyone would use this, the layout is the same to my [Aim](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/aim), I only use this addon to hide all original unit frames.

So here is the usage:

/ashunit unlock    - Unlock all unit frames, so you can move them, resize them, and use right mouse to toggle them.

/ashunit lock      - Lock all unit frames.
